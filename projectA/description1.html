    Living in the shallow sea, the sea snake stretches its body and moves forward smoothly. It has a big head and a small tail.

  <h2>HABITAT & BEHAVIOR</h2>

    The sea snake rests in reef caves in the shallow sea. They come to wide shallow waters for hunting, feeding on small fish and shrimps. When the sea snake meets other aggressive creatures, it will give off a dazzling yellow light to deter potential threats.
